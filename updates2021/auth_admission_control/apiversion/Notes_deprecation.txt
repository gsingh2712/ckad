Policy Rules

Api elements(k8s object) added in any version can only be deprecated from next higher released version
if /course is k8s obj in /v1alpha (version) in apigrp /kotekloud.com , it can be deleted in next /v1alpha2 (version)

Api Objects must be able to round-trip between API versions in a given release without information
loss, with the exception of whole REST resources  that do not exist in some versions.

Other than the most recent API version in each track, older API versions must be supported
after their announcements deprecation for a duration of no less than:
-> GA: 12 months or 3 k8s release version  (whichever is longer)
-> Beta: 9 months or 3 k8s release version (whichever is longer)
-> Alpha: 0 releases.

"Preferred" API vesion (means version used for storage in etcd) for a given group may not advance until after a k8s release has been 
made that supports both new version and the previous version.

A GA API version in a given track may not be deprecated until a new GA API version at least as stable is released.
