Core groups -> /api and /apis (name groups)

/apps /extensions  /networking.k8s.io /storage.k8s.io  --> apigroups

each apigrp has different versions 

/v1 --> GA stable version  , enabled by default
other versions like
/v1alpha  ...  , disabled by default , can be dropped in future , may have bugs , for early feedback from experts

/v1beta , next release after v1alpah , well tested , minor bugs , committed to be GA (/v1) , enabled by default 

An Apigrp can support multiple versions at the same time  it can /v1alpha ,  /v1beta , /v1 ....
   --> Though you may use any or all of them in the cluster, but the storage version can be only one of them
   --> Storage refers to k8s object storage in /etcd
   --> You can create the k8s object with any version but the storage in etcd will always be in one version ex:- 'apps/v1'


Enable / Disable a particular version add it to '--runtime-config' parameter of api server utility.

--runtime-config=api/all , --> take comma seperated value
