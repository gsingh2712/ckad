Kube api is grouped into multiple groups based on purpose like metrics , version , logs 

api :-  https://<apiserver endpoint>/api/v1/pods .. etc
health-api :-  https://<apiserver endpoint>/healthz
version :-  https://<apiserver endpoint>/version
apis :-  https://<apiserver endpoint>/apis

/api  (core group) and /apis  (named group) are core functionalities

/api --> /v1 --> /namespaces
                 /services
                 /pods
                 /secrets

named groups more organised and newer features will be available here , its groups under it for apps , extensions , networking


/apis --> /apps               --> /v1    --> /deployments
                                         --> /replicasets   
                                         --> /statefulsets
      --> /extensions
      --> /networking.k8s.io  --> /v1  --> /networkpolicies
      --> /storage.k8s.io
      --> .... 

apps , networking.k8s.io, storage.k8s.io, rbac.authorization.k8s.io --> these constitute resource groups while  deployments , replicasets, statefulsets  constitute resources under these api groups


Run 'kubectl proxy' before running below commands (it runs at localhost:8001) , it opens a proxy to apiserver using kubeconfig 

curl http://<kube_proxy> -k                      // Gives available api groups  
curl http://localhost:8001 -k 

curl http://<kube_proxy>/apis -k | grep "name"   // Gives resource groups
curl http://localhost:8001/apis -k | grep "name"

Kubectl proxy != kube proxy (it is a k8s networking construct for opening proxy across nodes , services and pods )
