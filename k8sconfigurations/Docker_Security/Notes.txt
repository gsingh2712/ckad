Docker by default runs the processes as root user within  the container AS WELL AS  THE HOST 

Docker containers are isolated using namespaces in Linux ,
Host has a namespace and container has a namespace.
  
Docker can only see process running inside it because it is running in its own namespace

While the host sees the process and docker process in namespace just as another process 


You can specfiy proccess to run as different user by specifying the userid  
docker run --user=1000 ubuntu sleep 3600 

OR Do the Below in DockerFile
FROM ubuntu 
USER 1000 

The image created from above DockerFile will run any command with user Id 1000


Ques 
What happens when you run Docker Containers as root user , is root user withing the contianer same
as the root user in the host ? Can proccess inside the container can do anything as root user inside  
host system ?

Docker implements security features that limit the capablites of root user within the container, like 
BROADCAST, NET_ADMIN , SYS_ADMIN , MAC_ADMIN ... etc , so the root user in the container is not same
as root user on the Host.

You can  use " cap-add / cap-drop " options add privileges to root user in container 

docker run  --cap-drop KILL ubuntu(image)  --> Drop KILL permission 
docker run  --cap-drop MAC_ADMIN  ubuntu(image)  --> Add Mac admin  permission 

To allow all privileges Use following command
docker run --privilege ubuntu
